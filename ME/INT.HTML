 <P><B> Question:</B> Can you describe the first thing you ever designed, either as a mechanical 
    engineer or before you started working in this field? </p>

  <P><B> Explanation: </B>This is a general or opening question which the interviewer will 
    ask to get you talking, to learn more about you, and to collect information they can use
     for subsequent questions. </p>

<P><B> Example: </B>“I actually began designing things when I was still a child. T
    he first design I can remember was a Rube Goldberg-type device that would dispense
     a piece of candy after several different mechanical steps. Another device I designed
      was a robotic machine that would collect a tennis ball and drop it into a basket. I
       did this while working on a team during a competition in high school. Projects like
        this fueled my interest in mechanical engineering as a career.” </p>

<P><B> Question:</B>What are the essential skills an engineer should possess? </p>

 <P><B> Explanation:</B> This is a general question the interviewer will ask to gain
     some understanding of your perspective of the field of mechanical engineering. 
     The best way to prepare for these types of questions is to reread the job posting
      so you clearly understand the skills the employer is looking for in this role. 
      Your answer should align with the skills you have and those highlighted in the job posting. </p>

<P><B> Example:</B> "I believe the most important quality an engineer should have is the ability to innovate.
     You have to look at things differently, developing new ways to accomplish a task that are more effective
      and efficient. Other important skills include flexibility, focus, attention to detail, and the ability
       to communicate complex ideas to nontechnical audiences.” </p>

<P><B> Question:</B> How do you use a process flow diagram in the field of mechanical engineering? </p>

<P><B> Explanation:</B> This is an operational question in which the interviewer is seeking to 
    understand how you perform a specific task.  Operational questions are best answered by walking
     the interviewer through the process you use or briefly explaining it. You don’t need to go into
      much detail because the interviewer will ask a follow-up question if they need more information. </p>

<P><B> Example:</B> “A process flow diagram is an illustration that describes the equipment, product flow,
     key connections, and the general relationships between various components used to move materials or 
     accomplish a task. It consists of drawings using symbols to describe the key components within the flow
      and lines between the symbols illustrating the direction of flow.” </p>

 <P><B> Question:</B> Can you explain the different types of fits used in the United States?  </p>

<P><B> Explanation:</B> This is a technical question. Interviewers will ask technical questions to 
    gain an understanding of the depth of your knowledge and experience. Technical questions should
     be answered straightforwardly and concisely. </p>

<P><B> Example:</B> “There are three categories of fit used here in the U.S. They include clearance,
     interference, and transition fit. Clearance fit is described as the clearance between two parts. 
     Interference fit describes the size of two parts to be mated where the hole tolerance is less than
      that of the shaft tolerance. Transition fit is a combination of the previous two where the toleranc
      e of both components overlap.” </p>

 <P><B> Question:</B> Since you mentioned tolerance, can you elaborate on the importance of tolerance
     in engineering? </p>

<P><B> Explanation:</B> This is an example of a follow-up question. The interviewer is asking you 
    to provide additional information related to your previous answer. You should anticipate follow-up
     questions whenever you provide an answer during an interview. </p>

<P><B> Example:</B> "Tolerances are critical in the field of mechanical engineering. Nothing can
     be designed without considering tolerances between the materials and components. Not only are
      tolerances vital to the design, but they can be used during quality inspections to reduce cost
       and facilitate manufacturing of the components.” </p>

<P><B> Question:</B> What are some of the computer programs you use in your work as a mechanical engineer? </p>

<P><B> Explanation:</B> This is another operational question. Not only is the interviewer seeking to 
    understand the types of computer programs you use, but they are also interested in finding out if
     the applications you use align with the programs their company uses. You can prepare for these 
     questions by doing thorough research on the company and its practices before the interview. </p>

<P><B> Example:</B> “I use several different tools and software in my work. The first is Mathcad which 
    gives me the ability to do math within a document as well as add relevant images and text to explain
     my work. When I need to perform a more complex numerical analysis, I use MATLAB. I use many different
      3D CAD software, including SolidWorks, Unigraphics NX, and Autodesk Inventor. Another tool I like is
       Finite Element Analysis (FEA) which is useful to any engineer needing to perform structural analysis.
        The software I probably use the most is Microsoft Excel along with Visual Basic for Applications.
         VBA is the programming language built into all of the Microsoft Office products and is useful for 
         automating Excel files.” </p>

<P><B> Question:</B> Can you discuss some of the essential guidelines for designing castings? </p>

<P><B> Explanation:</B> This is a technical question about a particular topic. As a mechanical engineer,
     you can anticipate that the majority of the questions you will be asked will be technical questions.
      You should prepare for these by reviewing your critical practices, tools, and information you use in 
      your work before you go to the interview. </p>

<P><B> Example:</B> “There were several key guidelines you need to follow when designing castings.
     These include designing casting while keeping simplicity as the first criteria, keeping the 
     section thickness as uniform as possible, averting sudden changes in thickness, avoiding large
      flat surfaces as these are difficult to create, and using curved shapes to improve the stress 
      handling of the casting.” </p>

<P><B> Question:</B> Can you describe a universal coupling and how it is used?   </p>

<P><B> Explanation:</B> By now, you should recognize this is another technical question.
     As the interview progresses, the technical questions will become more specific and more 
     complex.  This signifies that the interviewer is gaining confidence in your capabilities
      and is willing to explore more specific topics. You should be prepared for this by doing 
      thorough research and practicing before the interview. </p>

<P><B> Example</B>: “Simply stated, a universal coupling consists of a pair of hinges connected
     by a cross shaft. It is used to connect two shafts whose axes are inclined to each other. 
     An example of this would be a car where the driveshaft connects to the rear axle through a
      universal coupling.” </p>

<P><B> Question:</B> Do you prefer to use pneumatics to control the machinery you design, and if so, why? </p>

<P><B> Explanation:</B> This is another technical question about a specific topic. In this case,
     not only are you being asked about the issue, but the interviewer would also like to understand
      the rationale behind your answer. During an interview, you should carefully listen to the questions
       so your answer addresses everything about which the interviewer is asking. </p>

<P><B> Example:</B> “I prefer to design in pneumatic systems for the devices I engineer whenever 
    possible. Pneumatic systems are usually cheaper than other control systems, such as electromechanical
     or hydraulic systems. They are also faster, less complex, more efficient, and less messy if they 
     develop a leak.” </p>

<P><B> Question:</B> Can you explain mechanical refrigeration? </p>

<P><B> Explanation:</B> This is yet another technical question. You should be prepared
     for this based on the job posting and the research you did on the organization’s products 
     and engineering practices. While refrigeration is not required for a lot of engineering jobs,
      it is vital to this organization’s products. This illustrates how to prepare for specific job interviews. </p>

<P><B> Example:</B> “Mechanical refrigeration involves removing heat from a specific device or location
     by utilizing a heat exchange system.  Typically, the air is removed from the area and condensed.
      The heat from the condensed air is exhausted, and the condensed air, which is cooler, is sent back 
      into the area. The refrigeration system can be cyclic, non-cyclic, magnetic, or thermoelectric,
       depending on how the refrigeration is applied.” </p>
