                <P>When preparing for an Engineering freshers interview, you are supposed to know the basics of your subject and know them well. So, right from the language you use and the technical jargons, everything should be to the point and professional.</P>

                <P>If you have mentioned it on your job resume, then you must be prepared to answer interview questions around it. One of the major tips to face an interview, which many people often overlook, is knowing your projects. Many candidates go to the interview without any knowledge of their own work or the work they copied off someone else and passed off as their own.

                    So, read your project again, remember what you wrote there and why. As an engineering fresher, your assets are these said projects and internships and you must take them seriously.</P>

                    Often engineering freshers are also asked why they choose to be an engineer in the first place. So, don’t give answers like, “because my parents asked me to and I really had no choice”.
                    
                    Such answers will tell the recruiter that you are not really into engineering and might not stay faithful to the job too. So, be smart about your answer.</P>

        <LI><B>Dress up accordingly</B></LI>
        <P>How you look is really important for the recruiter. And, no, it has got nothing to do with how pretty your face is or how glossy your hair looks.

            It is about how well you dress up, and your personal hygiene. Also, fit and ironed clothes and nice personal etiquette can really help you on.</P>
