                <P><B> Questions</B>: Can you describe the software development process you use?</P>

<P><B> Explanation</B>: This is an example of an opening or general question. The interviewer will ask this type of question 
    to begin a conversation, get you talking, find out a little bit more about you, and collect information 
    they can use for subsequent questions.</P>

    <P><B> Example</B>: “The software development process I use is the 
same one I learned early in my career and is very typical in the industry.
 It begins with a requirement analysis which leads to the specifications and software
  architecture. Once they are completed, I move on to development, implementation, testing,
   and documentation. After this is done and the software is fully developed, my attention turns
    to training and support issues as well as ongoing maintenance and upgrades.”</P>

    <P><B> Questions</B>: In your opinion, what is the difference between computer software and a computer program?</P>

    <P><B> Explanation</B>: An interviewer will ask this type of question to begin to explore your knowledge, skills,
 experience, and qualifications for the job. Knowing the distinction between these two standard terms is 
 not that difficult but will indicate you are a viable candidate and convince the interviewer to proceed
  with the interview.</P>

  <P><B> Example</B>: “Many people confuse these two terms. The way I define them is that a computer 
program is a set of code that executes specific tasks. Computer software, on the other hand
, is an application that performs a function for the end-user. Computer software contains 
computer programs. Computer software is more user-centric, whereas computer programs are more machine-centric.”</P>

<P><B> Questions</B>: What types of development projects have you worked on recently?</P>

<P><B> Explanation</B>: The reason an interviewer will ask this question is to determine if 
you’ve recently done the type of work for which they are interviewing you. During the
 interview, your answers to an interviewer’s questions should address the needs of the employer
 . These are typically defined in the job posting. You may also be able to determine these during
  your pre-interview research about the company, its products, and practices.</P>

  <P><B> Example</B>: “Most recently, I have been working on OLTP applications. 
      Since most of my career has been in the financial industry, I began
       specializing in this type of programming. Areas I focus on are concurrency
        and atomicity. I have developed several sets of code around these functions 
        using a variety of different programming languages.”</P>

<P><B> Questions</B>: Which design patterns do you use, and in what situations do you use them?

 <P><B> Explanation</B>: This is an operational question. Interviewers ask operational
      questions to determine how you go about completing the tasks required by
       this role. Operational questions are best responded to succinctly and directly 
       with little embellishment. Additionally, you should always expect follow-up questions
        when an interviewer is asking about a specific task.</P>

  <P><B> Example</B>: “During my software development career, I’ve tried many 
      different design patterns. These include Singleton, MVC, and Template. 
      However, the one I prefer and use most often is Iterator. This helps me 
      code in an organized fashion and reduces the amount of time to develop the software. 
      It also results in fewer errors and less debugging.”</P>

<P><B> Questions</B>: What was the most challenging software development problem you have worked on, and how did it turn out?

<P><B> Explanation</B>: An interviewer will ask this question to gain
     an understanding of the scope of your experience and the
      type of projects you have worked on in the past. The query 
      is in the form of a behavioral question. You can respond to behavioral
       questions using the STAR framework. State the Situation, define the Task
        you need to complete, discuss the Action you took, then describe the Results you attained.</P>
<P><B> Example</B>: “The most challenging software project I’ve worked on recently involved an end-user
     application for managing team sports. The challenge was that end-users had to have secure 
     access to their own information without the ability to alter team or league data. I had to 
     develop the application on a short timeline and deploy it into a real-life scenario without 
     a great deal of testing. It also had to meet a price point which the market would accept.
      Recognizing that I did not have all the skills and experience necessary for this, I recruited
       some additional developers, and we collaborated on the project. Together we were able to produce 
       the software per the schedule and on budget.  This taught me to recognize my shortcomings and bring
        in additional resources when needed.”</P>

<P><B> Questions</B>: Tell me about the software development methodology you prefer?
<P><B> Explanation</B>: By asking this question, the interviewer is trying to 
    determine if you are a good fit for their organization. Software developers 
    can choose from a lot of different methodologies, but when working on a team,
     they all need to use the same methodology. Stating which methodology you use
      should be based on your pre-interview research. Your methodology should align with the
       one the company currently uses.</P>

<P><B> Example</B>: “The methodology I use most and prefer is Agile. 
    The reason I like this iterative framework is there are daily 
    stand-ups in which the team gets together to discuss the day’s development 
    goals and any issues we’ve encountered. The other reason I prefer to use Agile 
    methodology is because errors are identified and corrected at each stage of the process.
     This results in better quality software and less debugging at the end of the project.”</P>

<P><B> Questions</B>: What QA process have you worked with in the past?

<P><B> Explanation</B>: This is another operational question in which the interviewer is trying to 
    determine the type of quality control systems you have worked with. They are looking to 
    confirm that your processes are similar to the ones they use. Your experience doesn’t have 
    to be an exact match, but you should be able to transition to their process as quickly as possible.</P>

<P><B> Example</B>: “Since I develop using the Agile framework, the quality control processes I use the most are the
     ones used within this framework. I have worked with Waterfall, Just in Time, and SQA as well. I feel c
     omfortable transitioning between QA processes, and I am confident I can easily adapt to anything you 
     are using.</P>

<P><B> Questions</B>: How do you go about testing and finding bugs in applications you have developed?

<P><B> Explanation</B>: This is a follow-up to the previous question. Now that you told the interviewer what QA 
    processes you use, you should be able to describe how you go about testing and debugging software.
     During an interview, you should anticipate follow-up questions whenever you provide an answer to 
     the interviewer. This is why you should keep your answers short and direct. It provides the interviewer
      with an opportunity to either dive deeper into the topic or move on to something new.</P>

<P><B> Example</B>: “When developing software, I use unit testing tools to identify errors in my code. 
    I then go through a debugging process followed by more testing. Many people describe this process 
    as White Box Testing. The debugging tools I use include gdb and dbx which are both public domain products
    . The reason I prefer these is they provide command-line interfaces that are easier for me to work with. 
    Other tools I use include code-based tracers, profilers, and interpreters.”</P>

<P><B> Questions</B>: Can you describe what you know about object-oriented programming?

<P><B> Explanation</B>: This is a technical question. Technical questions are meant to probe your knowledge,
     experience, and qualifications for the position for which you are interviewing. Technical questions
      are easily answered by first defining the term you are being asked about and then providing an example
       of how it is used in your profession.</P>

<P><B> Example</B>: “I use object-oriented programming quite a bit. My definition of this is that it is the type
     of programming in which you define the data structure and also define the types of operations which 
     can be applied to the data. The benefit of this approach is that it helps you logically organize code
      around a specific parameter. It also makes code easier to be maintained and documented.”</P>

<P><B> Questions</B>: When you run into an obstacle during a software development project, how do you deal with it?

<P><B>Explanation</B>: This is another operational question in which the interviewer is trying to determine the steps
     you take when you run into an obstacle or setback during a programming project. Some operational questions
      are best responded to by taking the interviewer through the process you use step by step. Again, remember to
       keep your answer short and to the point. The interviewer will ask a follow-up question if they need 
       additional information.</P>

<P><B> Example</B>: “I have yet to work on a software development project where there haven’t been obstacles or setbacks.
     The key to dealing with them is to not get discouraged or distracted. I continue to focus on the task at hand
      and look for solutions to the obstacle I’ve encountered.  I utilize the collective knowledge of my entire 
      team to help solve problems. When that doesn’t work, I turn to my programming resource guides, online 
      resources, and other reference materials I can use to determine the best way to overcome the problem.”</P>

        <CENTER>  

            <P><B> Question:</B>  Can you provide an overview of the critical features of the Java programming
                 language? </P> 

            <P><B>  Explanation:</B>  This is an opening question which the interviewer will ask to start the 
                conversation, learn more about your background, and collect information they can use for subsequent
                 questions. </P> 
            
            <P><B>  Example:</B>  “Java has become the world’s most popular programming language because of its
                 many features. These include its simplicity and ease of programming, the fact that it is object
                  oriented, its portability across platforms, the built-in security features, its robustness due
                   to strong memory management, and its ability to create distributed applications.” </P> 
            
            <P><B> Question:</B>  Please define access modifiers and describe how they are used in Java. </P> 
            
            <P><B> Explanation:</B>  This is a technical question. You can recognize technical questions due to 
                their structure. They first ask you to define a term and then describe how it is used for the 
                function about which the interviewer is asking you. </P> 
            
            <P><B> Example:</B>  “Access modifiers are keywords that establish accessibility to methods, 
                classes, and other objects. There are four types, including public, protected, default, and 
                private. Each of these describes how the members within Java can be accessed and by whom.” </P> 
            
            <P><B> Question:</B>   What is the JDBC API, and how is it used within Java? </P> 
            
            <P><B> Explanation:</B>  The interviewer is asking you another technical question. Technical questions 
                are best answered directly and briefly. The interviewer will ask a follow-up question if they need 
                additional information or want to explore the topic in more depth. </P> 
            
            <P><B> Example:</B>  “Java database connectivity or JDBC API enables Java to work with relational 
                databases. This is part of the java.sql and javax.sql packages. Its function is to run SQL worries,
                 and stored procedures were then the relational database.” </P> 
            
            <P><B> Question:</B>  Can you briefly describe the different types of JDBC drivers and how they 
                relate to the JDBC API? </P> 
            
            <P><B> Explanation:</B>  This is a follow-up to the previous question. Any time you provide an 
                answer to the interviewer, you can anticipate a follow-up question. Keeping your answers brief
                 and to the point will enable the interviewer to move on to the next question or explore the topic
                  in more depth by asking a follow-up question. </P> 
            
            <P><B> Example:</B>  “The JDBC drivers actually do the work such as issuing queries and extracting
                 data once the JDBC API has connected to a relational database. There are four types of JDBC 
                 drivers available. These include the ODBC driver, the native API partly Java technology-enabled
                  driver, the pure Java driver for database middleware, and the direct-to-database pure Java driver. 
                  Each of these functions differently when connecting to and extracting data from relational databases.” </P> 
            
            <P><B> Question:</B>  How do path and classpath variables differ from each other? </P> 
            
            <P><B> Explanation:</B>  Another format a technical question can take is to provide you with two terms and ask you
                 the difference between them. The best way to structure your answer to this type of question is to define each
                  term and then describe their function and how they differ. An alternate form of this question may ask how 
                  the two terms relate to each other. </P> 
            
            <P><B> Example:</B>  “Both path and classpath variables allow Java to locate executables within the code. 
                Path is an environmental variable and contains the directory location of executables. Classpath is specific
                 to the Java programming language and is used for locating class files called by Java executables. These have
                  included ZIP files, JAR files, and others.” </P> 
            
            <P><B> Question:</B>  There is some confusion as to whether Java is pass by or pass by reference. What do you
                 believe, and why? </P> 
            
            <P><B> Explanation:</B>  While this is a technical question, it also asks for your opinion. Sometimes, 
                questions asking for opinions have no right answer. The interviewer is merely trying to understand 
                where you stand on a specific issue. However, in this question, there is a correct answer. Knowing 
                it will distinguish you as being qualified for this position. </P> 
            
            <P><B> Example:</B>  “I have heard people describe Java as being either pass by reference or pass by value.
                 According to the Java Spec, Java is pass by value. This relates to the variable paths and method calling.” </P> 
            
            <P><B> Question:</B>  How does Java use the final keyword? </P> 
            
            <P><B> Explanation:</B>  This is an operational question. Operational questions help the interviewer
                 understand how you go about performing a specific task required by this position. Like technical
                  questions, operational questions are best answered directly and succinctly. The interviewer will ask
                   you a follow-up question if they require additional details. </P> 
            
            <P><B> Example:</B>  “Java uses the final keyword with a class to make sure the other classes can’t extend it.
                 It also ensures that different methods cannot be overridden by any child class. Finally, it will classify 
                 variables as final so that it can only be assigned once.” </P> 
            
            <P><B> Question:</B>  What is Enum, and in what version of Java was it introduced? </P> 
            
            <P><B> Explanation:</B>  You probably already recognized this is a technical question. As a Java developer,
                 the majority of your interview will consist of technical and operational questions. You should continue 
                 to answer these directly and concisely. Keep in mind that every answer may generate a follow-up question. </P> 
            
            <P><B> Example:</B>  “Enum is a type whose field consists of a fixed set of constants. It was first introduced
                 in Java version 1.5.  A Java developer will establish the field and then define the constants which it can
                  contain. These constants are final and implicitly.” </P> 
            
            <P><B> Question:</B>  How is composition used while programming in Java? </P> 
            
            <P><B> Explanation:</B>  This is yet another technical question. As the interview progresses, the technical 
                questions will become more specific and more difficult. This indicates the interviewer is gaining confidence
                 in your capabilities and is willing to explore more complex topics. Continue to answer these more complicated
                  technical questions the same way you did the easier ones. </P> 
            
            <P><B> Example:</B>  “Composition is a design technique used in Java in several ways. It is used to implement
                 a relationship between classes and also for code reuse. It achieves this by using variables that refer to
                  different objects. Its benefit is that it provides control over the visibility of objects and client classes 
                  when the code is reused.” </P> 
            
            <P><B> Question:</B>   What function does the Java Reflection API perform? </P> 
            
            <P><B> Explanation:</B>  This is a hybrid technical and operational question. First, it asks you to
                 define a term and then discuss how it is used to perform a function. The best way to prepare for
                  this type of question is first to review the job description and identify the requirements for the position.
                   You should then research the company to better understand the type of programs they develop, the code they 
                   use, and their programming methodologies. Finally, before the interview, take some time to review standard 
                   Java development terms, processes, and methodologies. The last step is to practice questions like these. </P> 
            
            <P><B> Example:</B>  “The Java Reflection API gives the developer the ability to view and change the behavior of any
                 application while it is running. It allows you to inspect a variety of objects within Java and obtain their 
                 methods and details.” </P>

        <P><B> Question:</B>  Can you describe what the basic structure of a C++ program is?</P> 

        <P><B> Explanation:</B>  As a C++ developer, you can anticipate that the majority of your interview 
            will involve technical questions. This is an example of what a technical question looks like. The
             best way to answer technical questions is with a straightforward and concise manner.</P> 

        <P><B> Example:</B>  “The basic structure every C++ program will have is a preprocessor directive with
             a main function declaration followed by a block of code and then a returning point to the main 
             function which indicates successful execution of the program. The content, commands, and information
              in each of these sections can vary greatly, but the basic structure remains the same.”</P> 

        <P><B> Question:</B>  What is the purpose of comments in C++?</P> 


<P><B> Explanation:</B>  This is another technical question. Technical questions typically deal with definitions
     of terms or information used in the job for which you are interviewing. You can define the term and then 
     provide an example of how it is used.</P> 
<P><B> Example:</B>  "A comment in C++ is source code which is ignored by the compiler. 
    The programmer uses comments to add a description or additional information about their
     source code. There are two ways to add comments in C++. These include a single line comment
      denoted by // and a block comment which is indicated by /*.”</P> 

<P><B> Question:</B>  What is the difference between a declaration and definition of a variable used in C++?</P> 

<P><B> Explanation:</B>  Some technical questions will ask you to compare two different terms. The interviewer
     is attempting to discover the depth of your skills and knowledge in this field. You may want to define each
      term and then state their differences or how they are used.</P> 

<P><B> Example:</B>  “A declaration of a variable is used to specify the data type of a variable and the 
    variable name. This tells the compiler to reserve the space for a variable in the memory according to 
    the data type specified. A definition is the implementation of the declared variable which ties up an 
    appropriate value to the declared variable so the linker associates reference to the appropriate entities.”</P> 

<P><B> Question: </B> Can you discuss the difference between a local and global scope of a variable?</P> 

<P><B> Explanation:</B>  Again, the interviewer is asking you to compare two different terms used by C++ developers.
     This technical question is structured a little differently than the previous ones. When on an interview, make 
     sure you listen carefully to the interviewer’s questions and respond to them appropriately.</P> 

<P><B> Example:</B>  “There are two types of scope in C++, local and global. A variable has a local scope 
    when it is declared inside a code block. The variable remains active only inside the block and is not 
    accessible outside the code block. Conversely, a variable has a global scope when it is accessible by the 
    entire program. A global variable needs to be declared at the top of a program before all the function 
    definitions.”</P> 

<P><B> Question:</B>  When there is a global and a local variable in the program with the same names,
     which one takes precedence?</P> 

<P><B> Explanation:</B>  This is a follow-up question to the previous one. Interviewers will often ask 
    follow-up questions if they are looking for additional information or the topic they are asking about
     is important to them. You should always be prepared for follow-up questions during an interview.</P> 

<P><B> Example:</B>  “When a local variable has the same name as that of a global variable, the compiler 
    will always give precedence to the local variable. Programmers can still use variables with the same 
    names, but you need to keep this rule in mind. Sometimes it is easier to amend the variables’ names to
     simplify this issue.”</P> 

<P><B> Question:</B>  What is a constant in the context of a C++ program? Can you describe the different
     types of constants?</P> 

<P><B> Explanation:</B>  In this technical question, the interviewer is specifically asking you to define
     the concept and then provide an example. When the interviewer asks this type of question, make sure 
     you follow their directions precisely. In addition to determining your knowledge in this area, they are
      also testing to see how well you follow directions.</P> 

<P><B> Example:</B>  “In the context of a C++ program, a constant is a type of expression that has a fixed 
    value. Constants can be divided into integer, decimal, floating-point, character, or string, depending 
    on the type of data. C++ also supports octal and hexadecimal constants.”</P> 

<P><B> Question:</B>  As a programmer, how do you define and then declare constants in C++?</P> 

<P><B> Explanation:</B>  This technical question combines elements of several of the questions you
     already been asked. As the interview progresses, the interviewer will ask these types of compound
      questions. They’re digging deeper into your technical knowledge and ensuring you know how to use
       the programming elements you’ve already discussed.</P> 

<P><B> Example:</B>  “In C++, you define constants using the #define preprocessor directive. 
    Once you’ve defined a constant, you can use it throughout the program and substitute its value
    . You declare constants in C++ using the “const” keyword. This is similar to declaring a variable
     but with a constant prefix. Whenever the type of a constant is not specified, C++ compiler defaults 
     to an integer type.”</P> 

<P><B> Question:</B>  Can you comment on the function of an assignment operator in C++?</P> 

<P><B> Explanation:</B>  This is yet another technical question, and this one asks you to 
    comment on a particular element of C++ programming.  Although the format is different,
     the purpose is the same in that it wants you to define a term and then possibly provide
      an example of how it is used.</P> 

<P><B> Example:</B>  "An assignment operator in C++ is a command used to assign a value to 
    another variable. Two ports of the assignment operator are lvalue (left value) and rvalue 
    (right value). The left value will always be a variable, whereas the right value can be a constant,
     a variable, the result of an operation, or any combination of these. The assignment operation always
      takes place starting from the right and then moving to the left and never in the opposite direction.”</P> 

<P><B> Question:</B>  Can you describe what the arithmetic operators are in C++?</P> 

<P><B> Explanation:</B>  This technical question asks you to describe specific functions used within C++
     programming. To prepare for an interview, you should research the job posting as well as the company
      with which you are interviewing. This will help you narrow down the types of questions you can anticipate
       being asked so you can prepare your answers.</P> 

<P><B> Example:</B>  “C++ supports all of the basic arithmetic operators, including addition, subtraction, 
    multiplication, division, and percentage. These operators are the same as actual arithmetic operations.”</P> 

<P><B> Question:</B>  Can you explain the difference between a while and a do-while loop and describe how they
     are used?</P> 

<P><B> Explanation:</B>  The interviewer is asking you one more technical question. When preparing for
     an interview, you should practice these questions out loud. First, ask yourself the question or have
      somebody else do it, then answer the question out loud. This helps you develop muscle memory around
       the answer and practice how you will state your response.</P> 

<P><B> Example:</B>  “A while loop is a command which is executed as long as the condition in the given
     expression is true. In a while loop, the terminating condition is at the beginning of the loop, and
      once it is fulfilled, no further iterations of the loop are executed. In a do-while loop, the statement
       inside the loop is executed at least once. This is because the loop condition is at the end. These are 
       the main differences between the while and do-while loops.</P>

<P><B> Question:</B>  Why did you choose to pursue a career in web development?</P> 

<P><B> Explanation:</B>  This is a general or opening question which the interviewer will use to 
    begin the conversation, learn more about your background, and uncover some information they can
     use for future questions.</P> 

<P><B> Example:</B>  “I’ve always enjoyed technology and interacting with interesting websites
     and gaming applications. In college, my fascination with this turned into a vocation. 
     I enjoyed my IT-related classes the most and decided to pursue a career as a web developer.
      I really enjoy this work and have never looked back, knowing I made the right choice.”</P> 

<P><B> Question:</B>  Please describe a project you’ve developed and the approach you took from 
    conception to launch.</P> 

<P><B> Explanation:</B>  This is another general question which is attempting to learn more about your background.
     Your answer should align with the type of projects the employer is looking to hire you for. You can determine
      this by doing pre-interview research, visiting their website, and going to job boards to read how employees 
      describe the work they do.</P> 

<P><B> Example:</B>  “My favorite project was developing a website that provided educational resources 
    to children. I enjoyed this because of the site’s focus, its content, and working with children to 
    determine how they would navigate the site both with and without parental supervision. It was a 
    challenging project which turned out well and is currently used by millions of kids.”</P> 

<P><B> Question:</B>  How would you explain the concept of plug-ins to someone who doesn’t have a 
    technical background?</P> 

<P><B> Explanation:</B>  An interviewer will ask this type of question to determine your understanding
     of a topic as well as your communication skills.  Describing technical subjects to nontechnical 
     people requires you to avoid using jargon and any terms which the nontechnical person may not understand.
      This is a common practice for web developers who need to collaborate with project stakeholders and other
       nontechnical individuals.</P> 

<P><B> Example:</B>  “When asked to describe a concept like plug-ins to a nontechnical person,
     I make sure to avoid using jargon and any technical terms they may not understand. My answer 
     would be something like this, 'Plug-ins are pieces of code that perform a specific function on
      a website. The advantage of plug-ins is that they have already been developed and tested. 
      Using them ensures the function will work properly and avoids me having to develop and code
       the application myself. This makes my website more reliable and reduces the amount of time
        needed to develop it.'”</P> 

<P><B> Question:</B>  What do you know about namespacing in JavaScript?</P> 

<P><B> Explanation:</B>  This is a technical question that asks you to define a term used in this job.
     Technical questions are best answered concisely and directly with little embellishment. The 
     interviewer will ask a follow-up question if they need additional information about the topic.</P> 

<P><B> Example:</B>  “In the context of JavaScript, a namespace is a global object with a unique name
     that holds methods, properties, and other objects. Its purpose is to increase the modularity and 
     reuse of code in web applications. It also hopes to prevent naming conflicts within the code.” </P> 

<P><B> Question:</B>  Can you tell me the differences between REST and SOAP?</P> 

<P><B> Explanation:</B>  This is another technical question in which the interviewer is asking you to compare
     two terms. The best way to respond to this is first to define each term and then describe how it is used 
     in website development. You should also anticipate a follow-up question once you provide your answer.</P> 

<P><B> Example:</B>  “REST and SOAP are both web service protocols. The difference between them is that SOAP
     uses XML, while REST supports JSON, text, and several other formats. I prefer to use REST because of its 
     flexibility and the options it provides.”</P> 

<P><B> Question:</B>  What are some of the new input types that were included in HTML5?</P> 

<P><B> Explanation:</B>  This is another technical question in which the interviewer is seeking to understand
     your knowledge of HTM5. As a seasoned web developer, you should be knowledgeable in a variety of different
      programming languages. While HTML5 has been around for some time, its new features should still be something
       you can address.</P> 

<P><B> Example:</B>  “When HTML5 was announced a few years ago, it came with several different features that 
    were new to HTML. These features included daytime-local, e-mail, month, number range, color, date, search,
     URL, and week. These features made it a lot easier to include these elements on a website without additional
      coding.”</P> 

<P><B> Question:</B> What content management systems (CMS) do you have experience with?</P> 

<P><B> Explanation:</B>  The interviewer is using this operational question to determine the scope
     of your knowledge with different content management systems which are also known as CMS. Operational
      questions help the interviewer understand how you go about doing this job. Again, you should mention
       CMSs in your answer that align with the same ones the employer uses. You can usually find these out
        by examining their website and looking at the source code. </P> 

<P><B> Example:</B>  “Throughout my career, I have worked with several different content management systems.
     The ones I prefer include WordPress, Joomla, and Drupal. Of these, I prefer WordPress. This is one of 
     the most ubiquitous CMSs and has a large library of plug-ins and other components to work with.”</P> 

<P><B> Question:</B>  How would you describe your SQL skills?</P> 

<P><B> Explanation:</B>  This is a direct question asking you to describe your skills with a specific operation
     used in website development. People usually have a tendency not to brag or be too boisterous about their 
     skills and qualifications. During an interview, you have to avoid this tendency. Now is the time for you t
     o brag about how good you are in certain areas. The interviewer is expecting this and will not be offended.
      The key is not overstating your qualifications. This could be disastrous if they hired you, and you were not
       able to perform the required tasks.</P> 

<P><B> Example:</B>  “I have solid SQL skills. I’ve done quite a bit of work with both SQL Server and MySQL.
     I’m confident I can integrate the functionality of SQL into any website I develop.”</P> 

    <P><B> Question:</B>  Which programming languages do you code in, and which of them do you prefer 
        to work with?</P> 

<P><B> Explanation:</B>  There are many different languages you can use to design a website.
     The key is knowing and naming the same ones the employer’s development or design team currently
      uses. This will align your skills with their current operations. You can locate this information 
      before the interview by examining their websites and searching for comments that current employees 
      made about the employer on sites such as Glassdoor or Indeed.</P> 

<P><B> Example:</B>  “I am competent in several different programming languages used for web development
     and design. These include Python, JavaScript, CSS and HTML, C++, PHP, and C. Of these, I prefer Python
      and JavaScript which I’ve noticed your organization uses for the websites you publish.”</P> 

<P><B> Question:</B>  Have you ever done pair programming, and what do you think of it?</P> 

<P><B> Explanation:</B>  Pair programming is a relatively new development within the website 
    development and design field. This involves two people working together to code a project.
     If you have experience with this, you can state so and describe your preferences for designing
      a website using this methodology. If you haven’t, you can express your familiarity with the practice
       and describe whether you would be inclined to use it in the future.</P> 

<P><B> Example:</B>  “While I have never used pair programming to design a website, I am familiar with
     the practice. I understand the benefits it provides by including two different perspectives, background,
      and knowledge to design a website faster and more accurately. However, I do my best work in isolation
       and would prefer to work alone whenever possible. I am open to peer review and often use it to increase
        the quality of my designs and to identify anything I may have missed.”</P>
